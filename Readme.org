#+TITLE: Fundamentals

*NOTE: Fundamentals are still WIP*

Fundamentals is a set of core utilities that aims to be as simple
as possible without sacrificing compatibility with /POSIX/.

* Build instructions
** What you need
1. C++20 compiler
2. Meson build system
3. (Optionally) *scdoc* for generating manpages

** How to build
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  meson setup Build
  meson compile -C Build/
#+END_SRC

*** Test installation directory
A *test installation directory* may help you if you are tinkering with this project.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  meson configure Build/ -Dprefix=${PWD}/Install

  meson install -C Build/
  ./Install/bin/echo 'Hello, World'
#+END_SRC
